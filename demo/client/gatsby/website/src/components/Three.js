          <p>Elucid is an extension of graphql.js that improves GraphQL's error messaging and status code handling.</p>

        It's lightweight and easy to get off the ground. It's not an entire framework for developers to adopt, just something to make their lives a little easier.
        </p>
        <p>
        We believe Elucid is the most essential, minimalist error handling library for Javascript implementations of GraphQL available today. We hope youâ€™ll give it a try and find that it helps illuminate the path forward in your own projects.
