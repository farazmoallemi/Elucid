          <p>We wanted to build an extension of graphql.js that wouldn’t require opting into an entire network layer ecosystem between client and server.</p>
        </header>
        <p>
        We just wanted something lightweight, direct, and easy to get off the ground. Something that felt less like an entire framework for developers to adopt, and more like a plugin to make their lives just a little bit easier and more illustrative when it comes to communicating with a GraphQL server.
        </p>
        <p>
        We believe Elucid is the most essential, minimalist error handling library for Javascript implementations of GraphQL available today. We hope you’ll give it a try and find that it helps illuminate the path forward in your own projects.
